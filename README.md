# Design Handoff Project

This week we were teamed up with the UX-design students and they handed over a design in figma. This was the first time we got to work togethe with a designer.

Due to limited time my site does not follow the design all the way.

### The Problem

My biggest struggle this week was time. The given design was quite detailed and I did not manage to make all the features work. I struggled alot with the hambuger menu but used npm library to manage it.

One other problem was that the design in figma was not optimized for bigger viewpoints than mobile. I discussed this with the designer and we agreed that I should try to choose font sizes that look good on the screen rather than strictly following the design.

If I had more time I would try to make the site follow the design more closely. I would also like to add more animation that the designer talked about.
